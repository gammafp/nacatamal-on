# NacatamalOn

NacatamalOn is a game engine developed in TypeScript/Rust/Zig inspired by functional programming in his core.

It is a work in progress, and the goal is to create a game engine that is easy to use, flexible, and powerful.

### Features
- TypeScript support
- Functional programming inspired
- WebGPU support
- Modular architecture
- Easy to use API
- Cross-platform support
- Support for 2D and 3D games
- Support for WebAssembly (advance stage, not guaranteed)
- Support for Rust and Zig as scripting languages (advance stage not guaranteed)

### Zig part:

Interoperability with C libraries and Rust libraries is a key feature of Zig, allowing you to call C functions and use C libraries directly in your Zig code. This is particularly useful for integrating existing libraries or leveraging system APIs.
